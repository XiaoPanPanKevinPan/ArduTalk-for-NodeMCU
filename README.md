# ArduTalk for NodeMCU

Implement ArduTalk on NodeMCU (ESP8266 on ESP-12E) and NodeMCU-32s (ESP32 on ESP-32S).

Device Model: "NodeMCU"

The available device features are listed as follows:


- IDF: "A0" (may be labelled as "SVP" on NodeMCU-32s)


- ODF: "D0~", "D1~", "D2~", "D5", "D6", "D7" and "D8" 
  (may be labelled as "P16", "P5", "P4", "P14", "P12", "P13" and "P15" on NodeMCU-32s, respectively), 
  where "D0~", "D1~", "D2~" provide PWM signals.
